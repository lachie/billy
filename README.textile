A very simple cocoa app for editing PDF metadata. Hooks into Spotlight for the educational value to me.

h1. motivation

We bought a "Fujitsu ScanSnap":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP-2IptM-TY which is freaking awesome.

All this talk about "to-everything bucket-or-not":http://al3x.net/2009/01/31/against-everything-buckets.html and "openmeta":http://ironicsoftware.com/community/comments.php?DiscussionID=632&page=1#Item_0 made me want to look into the whole OS X metadata thing.

As it turns out, there's a whole lot of yummy tech happening just under the surface, just beyond the reach of the developer. Typically apple.

So anyway. I built this wee app to have a look around. Since I'm just dealing with PDFs I can use the PDFKit api and don't have to worry about breaking the space time continuum as openmeta is accused of doing.

h1. mechanics

You just read the PDF file, touch up its attributes and write it back. Spotlight notices (via FSEvents) and re-indexes it straight away.

After that you can use finder smart folders to be smart n stuff.

Although Bindings is still a little elusive to me, I'm getting there finally!

h1. todo

# add prefs
# unhardcode the path it reads
# add some processed/unprocessed logic
# add some searching
# add some grouping (might just leave it to finder though)
